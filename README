Reading Results:

"Total Prefetches By All": Total # of *Unique* Prefetches by All Prefetchers 
    - If Prefetchers X, Y share Prefetch Request K, then K is only counted once.

"Unique Prefetches By X": Number of Unique Prefetches by *only* X (exclusive)
    - If Prefetchers X, Y share Prefetch Request K, then K is *not* counted in this metric.

"Prefetches Shared by (X, Y)": Number of Prefetches Shared between X, Y (inclusive)
    - If Prefetchers X, Y, Z share Prefetch Request K, then K is counted between (X, Y), (X, Z), *and* (Y,Z).
