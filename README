So far:
    shows isect data between 4 txt files representing prefetches, on a call to tracker->output_results();
    prefetch struct ready to compare actual instruction IDs, addresses, maybe not levels if all LLC
To run current test:
    compile with "g++ -std=c++11 -o count count.cc"
    run with "./count"

TODO:
    compile with gzstream correctly
    run a test on the 4 astar files listed on count.cc
    make sure that works, then write code that will do it on the entire dataset
    come up with a good visualization for the data?
